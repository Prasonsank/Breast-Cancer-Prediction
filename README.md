# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview
Breast cancer prediction using machine learning to classify tumors as benign or malignant.  
The project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models to make accurate predictions on medical data.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses the breast cancer dataset  
- Performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- Trains and evaluates different classification models  
- Compares model performance based on accuracy and other metrics  
- Provides predictions to assist in early detection of breast cancer  

## Files
- `Breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation, analysis, and results.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, available in scikit-learn’s datasets module or from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

## Results
- Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between **benign** and **malignant** tumors.  
- Showed how preprocessing and feature selection improve machine learning performance.
