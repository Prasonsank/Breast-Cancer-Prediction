# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview
Breast cancer prediction using machine learning to classify tumors as benign or malignant.  
This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Training and testing multiple machine learning models  
- Accuracy comparison across models  
- Prediction on new patient data
